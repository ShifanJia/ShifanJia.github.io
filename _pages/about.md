I am a first year statistics Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof.Haolun](https://haoluns.wordpress.com/) and [Prof.Guan](https://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/mathematics/directory/tianyu-guan/#publicationsdeb8-70a5) at Simon Fraser University. Previously, I graduated from George Washington University with MSc in Statistics. 

My current research interests are functional data analysis (FDA) and biostatistics, especially on function-on-function nonlinear regression model.
