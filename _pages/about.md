I am a first year statistics PhD student supervised by [Prof.Haolun](https://haoluns.wordpress.com/) at Simon Fraser University. Previously, I graduated from George Washington University with MSc in Statistics. 

My current research interests are functional data analysis (FDA) and biostatistics, espeically on function-on-function nonlinear regression model.
