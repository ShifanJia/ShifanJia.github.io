Welcome! I am a third year statistics Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof.Haolun Shi](https://haoluns.wordpress.com/) and [Prof.Tianyu Guan](https://tianyuguan.github.io/) at Simon Fraser University. Previously, I earned my MSc in Statistics from George Washington University.

My current research focuses on functional data analysis (FDA) and its applications in biostatistics, machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs).
